# Sudoku Solver with Enhanced Features

This project is a **Sudoku Solver** implemented in **C++** using the backtracking algorithm. It solves a given Sudoku puzzle and offers additional features like generating puzzles, tracking recursion calls, and showing the total time taken to solve the puzzle. It also includes a simple Sudoku puzzle generator for creating random puzzles with varying difficulty.

## Features

- **Sudoku Solver**: Solves a given Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
- **Puzzle Generator**: Generates a random Sudoku puzzle with a specified number of pre-filled cells.
- **Recursion Count**: Tracks the number of recursive calls made by the backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
- **Puzzle Display**: Displays the Sudoku puzzle at each stage (initial, solved, and generated).
- **Easy Difficulty Level**: Generates a puzzle with a user-specified number of pre-filled cells.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., **g++** or **clang++**)
- Basic understanding of the Sudoku game and backtracking algorithm

## Installation

To get started with the Sudoku Solver, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (or copy the code into a file):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git
